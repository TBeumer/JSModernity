# ECMAScript versions
- minimal version taken into account: ES3 -> so features from earlier versions are shown as ES3 even though they might be from ES1 for example

### Known Issues
- temp_sig_gen_* folders sometimes fail to get deleted after signature generation. After the signature generation is done you can safely delete these folders manually.
